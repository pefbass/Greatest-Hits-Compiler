This submission includes my stringset ADT, oc compiler, and makefile. My
stringset ADT borrows heavily from the provided one although I have modified
dump_stringset() to accept a pointer to an open filestream instead of a file.
oc.cpp borrows from the provided auxlib.h and .cpp file to accommodate the -@
flag that can be run with the oc command.

No bugs were found in this submission EXCEPT that I was unable to get oc to
work properly with multiple flags at once (-ly, -D string, and -@ flags). Use
of oc is operational with one flag at a time.
