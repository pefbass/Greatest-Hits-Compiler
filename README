* * * * * * * PLEASE GRADE THIS SUBMISSION AS ASSIGNMENT 2 * * * * * * *

I was not able to get the emitter to work without segmentation faults that
would delete the entire .oil file, so I am resubmitting assignment 2 instead.

I received 27.0 / 60.0 on assignment 2 but fixed the issues right at the start
of assignment 3. I am resubmitting assignment 2 to potentially earn back the
33 points I lost since I believe it is more than I would receive for submitting
my attempt at project 5.

I was unable to get oc to work properly with multiple flags at once (-ly,
-D string, and -@ flags). Use of oc is operational with one flag at a time.
