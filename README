I was unable to get oc to work properly with multiple flags at once (-ly,
-D string, and -@ flags). Use of oc is operational with one flag at a time.

With this specific submission, I was not able to get the tokens to actually
print to the .tok file despite all of the printing code being present in the
dump_node() function of astree.cpp. the newfilename() function for lexer
does successfully print to the .tok file, though.
